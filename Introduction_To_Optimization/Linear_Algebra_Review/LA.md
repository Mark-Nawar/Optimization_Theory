A column $n$-vector is a matrix with $n$ rows and 1 column. We denote a column $n$-vector by
$$
a = \\begin{bmatrix}
a_1 \\\\
a_2 \\\\
\\vdots \\\\
a_n
\\end{bmatrix}
$$
The number $a_i$ is called the $i^{th}$ component of the vector $a$. The set of real numbers is denoted by $\mathbb{R}$, and the set of column $n$-vectors with real components is denoted by $\mathbb{R}^n$. We commonly denote elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$ by lowercase bold letters (e.g., $x$), and the components of $x$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are denoted $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$. A row $n$-vector is defined as $[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]$.
